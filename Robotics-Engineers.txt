Robootics Engineers
Job Description
A Robotics Engineer designs, develops, and tests robotic systems and devices that automate processes and solve complex tasks. These
professionals combine mechanical, electrical, and computer engineering principles to build robots for industries like manufacturing,
healthcare, aerospace, and consumer goods. Robotics Engineers play a critical role in creating machines that improve productivity,
precision, and safety.

Skills required
Robotics engineering is a multidisciplinary field requiring a mix of technical and analytical skills. Below are the five core skills needed:

 Programming.
 Mechanical Design.
 Electronics and Circuit Design.
 Control Systems.
 Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.

Educational Requirements
To become a Robotics Engineer, a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Mechanical Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Robotics, or Mechatronics is
the minimum requirement. This degree provides the foundational knowledge needed to design robotic systems.

For advanced roles or specialization in AI robotics or humanoid robots, a Masterâ€™s degree or certiﬁcations in robotics, automation, or
AI can be beneﬁcial. Many engineers also gain practical skills through robotics competitions, internships, or online courses in robot
programming and control.

Duties and Responsibilities
Robotics Engineers handle multiple aspects of the design and operation of robots. Key responsibilities include:

  1.   Designing and building robotic systems and components.
  2.   Programming robots to perform specific tasks.
  3.   Testing and debugging robotic systems to ensure reliability and safety.
  4.   Integrating sensors and actuators into robotic designs.
  5.   Collaborating with teams to adapt robots for specific industrial or commercial applications.
