Penetration Tester
Job Description
A Penetration Tester, also known as an ethical hacker, is a cybersecurity expert who simulates attacks on computer systems, networks,
and applications to identify vulnerabilities that could be exploited by malicious hackers. They conduct controlled security tests to assess
the eﬀectiveness of an organizationâ€™s security measures, identifying weaknesses before cybercriminals can exploit them. Penetration
testers use various tools and techniques, including network sniﬃng, password cracking, and social engineering, to simulate real-world
attacks in order to discover flaws and recommend improvements.

Penetration Testers play an essential role in the cybersecurity team, working proactively to safeguard an organization's digital assets,
ensuring that its systems are resilient against cyber threats. They may be hired by companies directly or work as part of third-party
security ﬁrms, and their ﬁndings help shape security policies and strategies. Their work requires constant learning, as cybersecurity
threats evolve and new tools and techniques emerge.

Skills required
Penetration Testers need a broad range of skills that combine technical expertise, problem-solving, and ethical judgment. The key skills
include:

 Network Security Knowledge.
 Vulnerability Assesment Tools.
 Programming and Scripting.
 Operating System Expertise.
 Knowledge of Security Frameworks and Standards.

Educational Requirements
To become a Penetration Tester, the typical educational path involves earning a Bachelor's degree in Cybersecurity, Information
Technology, Computer Science, or a related ﬁeld. This degree provides foundational knowledge of network systems, operating systems,
and security protocols.

Penetration Testers are also expected to hold certiﬁcations that demonstrate expertise in ethical hacking and cybersecurity. While a
degree is beneﬁcial, hands-on experience, self-study, and participation in Capture the Flag (CTF) challenges and ethical hacking
competitions can significantly enhance skills and marketability.

Duties and Responsibilities
Penetration Testers are responsible for performing security assessments and providing actionable recommendations. Their key duties
include:

  1. Conducting thorough vulnerability assessments, penetration tests, and risk assessments on networks, systems, and applications.
  2. Exploiting security weaknesses in a controlled, ethical manner to determine how easily systems could be compromised.
  3. Documenting ﬁndings from penetration tests, including a detailed report of vulnerabilities, attack paths, and suggestions for
     remediation.
  4. Staying up to date on the latest cybersecurity trends, threats, and attack methodologies to continuously improve testing techniques.
  5. Advising on security improvements and helping organizations to mitigate future risks.
