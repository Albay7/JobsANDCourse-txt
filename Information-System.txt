INFORMATION SYSTEM
Course Description

The information System program provides students with foundation knowledge on organizations and Information and Communication
Technology (ICT). It allows students to understand how ICT can enable organizations to improve performance and achieve competitive
advantage. It trains students to develop strong analytical, technical and leadership skills to thrive in a global environment as future
information systems professionals.

Information Systems (IS) is the study of how technology, people, and processes work together to collect, manage, and use information in
organizations. This course focuses on understanding how businesses use systems and tools to improve operations, make decisions, and
solve problems. Unlike pure computer science, Information Systems combines technology with business principles, teaching students
how to analyze and design systems that support organizational goals. The course is ideal for those interested in both technology and how
it applies to business strategies and management.

What to learn

Students in an Information Systems course develop a blend of technical and business skills, such as:

     Understanding how information systems support business operations and decision-making.
     Learning to design, develop, and implement information systems.
     Exploring databases, data analysis, and system modeling.
     Studying enterprise systems like CRM (Customer Relationship Management) and ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning).
     Learning about cybersecurity and how to protect information assets.
     Analyzing the impact of technology on organizations and their strategies.

The course also focuses on problem-solving, teamwork, and communication skills, as IS professionals often act as a bridge between
technical teams and business leaders.
