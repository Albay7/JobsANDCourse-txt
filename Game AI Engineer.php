            <h2>Job Description</h2>
            <p style="font-size:16px;">
                A Game AI Engineer is responsible for creating and implementing artificial intelligence systems within video games, enabling non-player characters (NPCs) and the game environment to react intelligently to player actions. Their work includes designing algorithms that control NPC behavior, such as movement, decision-making, combat, and interactions with the game world. Game AI engineers utilize techniques like pathfinding (e.g., A* algorithms), behavior trees, and finite state machines (FSM) to create dynamic, responsive NPCs. Additionally, they may work on more complex AI systems that adapt and learn from player behavior, improving over time to create more challenging and personalized gaming experiences.
            </p>
            <p style="font-size:16px;">
                In addition to designing AI systems, a key responsibility of a Game AI Engineer is optimizing performance to ensure smooth gameplay, particularly in large-scale games with numerous NPCs or complex interactions. They focus on making AI algorithms efficient so that they don’t negatively impact game performance. Strong programming skills in languages like C++, C#, and Python, along with experience in game engines like Unity or Unreal Engine, are essential for developing and integrating AI systems.
