        <div class="blog-post">
            <h2>Educational Requirements</h2>
            <p style="font-size:16px;">
                To become a Hardware Design Engineer, the typical educational path begins with a Bachelor’s degree in a related field, such as Electrical Engineering (EE), Computer Engineering, or Electronic Engineering. This degree provides essential knowledge in digital and analog circuit design, embedded systems, microcontroller programming, PCB design, and other core topics like signal processing and power electronics.
                A Bachelor's degree equips students with the theoretical and practical skills required for designing and developing hardware systems, making it the minimum educational requirement for entering the profession.
            </p>
            <p style="font-size:16px;">
                While a Master’s degree is not mandatory, it can significantly enhance career prospects and expertise, especially for engineers aiming to specialize in areas such as ASIC design, FPGA programming, or high-speed digital design. A Master's program delves deeper into advanced topics like System-on-Chip (SoC) design, signal integrity, and power management, and provides opportunities for research or involvement in cutting-edge projects.
