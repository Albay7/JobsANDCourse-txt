            <h2>Job Description</h2>
            <p style="font-size:16px;">
                A Cyber Threat Intelligence Analyst is a cybersecurity expert who gathers, analyzes, and interprets data about potential and ongoing cyber threats to help organizations strengthen their security posture. Their primary goal is to provide actionable insights that will enable proactive defense against cyberattacks. The analyst uses a combination of open-source intelligence (OSINT), internal threat data, and collaboration with other cybersecurity teams to identify emerging threats, track threat actors, and monitor for indicators of compromise (IOCs).
            </p>
            <p style="font-size:16px;">
                Cyber Threat Intelligence Analysts not only analyze raw data but also work closely with security teams to develop strategies for responding to potential threats. They help organizations understand the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) of cyber adversaries, allowing teams to defend against them more effectively. Additionally, they assist in creating and enhancing threat models, vulnerability assessments, and incident response plans. Given the evolving nature of cyber threats, these analysts must be proactive, continuously monitoring and gathering intelligence to stay ahead of cybercriminals and nation-state actors. This role requires a deep understanding of cybersecurity principles, threat analysis, and the ability to communicate complex information in a clear and concise manner to non-technical stakeholders.
